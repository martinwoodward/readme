# ⭐ How it works
If you have a file at the root of your project with the name README.md, it is automatically rendered for users when they come to visit your projects. It's the first page that they see and so is a great place for you to introduce the project and help people get started with it. When talking with projects the ReadMe file is something that I frequently give advice on so wanted to collect some of this advice into a common place.

# ☑️ ReadMe Top Tips Checklist

- [ ] Include an attractive screenshot or header image at the start of your readme (above the fold). Thanks to GitHub's now built-in TOC rendering you no longer need to include links to the rest of the page as this information will always stay above the fold.
- [ ] Include badges that indicate the health of your project such as the state of the current CI build etc. These are great indicators of activity however don't go overboard with them.
- [ ] Explain what the project is about
- [ ] Explain how to contribute to the project and expectations of being part of your community (for example a link to the Code of Conduct). If you are not accepting contributions then let people know.
